## 🧐 Problem Statement <a name = "problem_statement"></a>
Small parcel transportation can cost up to 4-5 times more in emerging markets than it does in 
developed markets for enterprises who import and manufacture textile and apparel goods. As a result, tens of 
thousands of small-scale companies rely on unofficial shipping networks to save money.
Another problem is the security and delay in their packages and luggage. 


## 💡 Idea / Solution <a name = "idea"></a>
 This website will provide the companies shipping facilities with high quality delivery with proper 
security and also will help to take and bring packages on time. Shippers and travelers can contact, it will save 
them from security hassles.
## 💡 Getting Start
Creating react app

```sh
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```

If you've previously installed `create-react-app` globally via `npm install -g create-react-app`, we recommend you uninstall the package using `npm uninstall -g create-react-app` or `yarn global remove create-react-app` to ensure that npx always uses the latest version.


Then open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to see your app.<br>
When you’re ready to deploy to production, create a minified bundle with `npm run build`.
